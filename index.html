       Hello here's what I've got so far for assignment 1! I've included an image that I hand made using a touchpad on a laptop 
        on microsoft paint. Here's also a link to a page I made previously.
      <a href="https://pazosandrew.github.io/MMP240-midterm/"> Link to a project on github pages from last semester</a>
    </p> 
       
    <p> Included is another link that I've included to fulfill the several links requirement!. <a href="https://p5js.org">  Here's a way to get to p5 </a>
